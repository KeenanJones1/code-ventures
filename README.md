# Technical ventures for PRX candidates

This repo contains some possible ideas/projects for PRX developer
candidates, as part of our [Hiring Process](https://github.com/PRX/docs.prx.org/blob/master/external/hiring.md).

If you do decide to use one of these projects, please let us know
so we can duplicate this repo to one just for you. And you can make
a non-public PR with your changes over there.
