## Tasks

I've done a terrible job writing this app, and the PRX CTO is furious.
He has called me names, and questioned my lunch choices.
While I'm sobbing under my desk, pick a few tasks to make things better.

These are in no particular order, so feel free to pick a variety that
demonstrate your breadth and depth of skillz.
